    "# Leash Bio - Predict New Medicines with BELKA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Small molecule drugs play a crucial role in modern medicine, often targeting specific proteins to treat various diseases. However, with a vast chemical space to explore, traditional drug discovery methods can be laborious and time-consuming. The Leash Bio competition, \"Predict New Medicines with BELKA,\" aims to revolutionize small molecule binding prediction by leveraging machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "The competition dataset comprises binary classifications indicating whether a small molecule binds to one of three protein targets. The data were collected using DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) technology. Each example includes SMILES representations of building blocks and the fully assembled molecule, along with protein target names and binary binding classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files\n",
    "- **train/test.[csv/parquet]:** Contains training or test data in both csv and parquet formats.\n",
    "  - `id`: Unique identifier for the molecule-binding target pair.\n",
    "  - `buildingblock1_smiles`, `buildingblock2_smiles`, `buildingblock3_smiles`: SMILES representations of building blocks.\n",
    "  - `molecule_smiles`: SMILES representation of the fully assembled molecule.\n",
    "  - `protein_name`: Name of the protein target.\n",
    "  - `binds`: Binary class label indicating whether the molecule binds to the protein (not available for the test set).\n",
    "- **sample_submission.csv:** Sample submission file in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Competition Data\n",
    "Leash Biosciences provides approximately 98M training examples per protein, 200K validation examples per protein, and 360K test molecules per protein. The test set contains building blocks not present in the training set, ensuring generalizability. The datasets are highly imbalanced, with only about 0.5% of examples classified as binders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protein Targets\n",
    "The competition focuses on predicting binding affinity for three protein targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **EPHX2 (sEH):** Encoded by the EPHX2 genetic locus, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a potential drug target for conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes. Crystal structures and amino acid sequences are provided for contestants wishing to incorporate protein structural information.\n",
    "2. **BRD4:** Bromodomain 4 plays roles in cancer progression, and inhibiting its activity is a strategy for cancer treatment. Crystal structures and sequences are available for contestants.\n",
    "3. **ALB (HSA):** Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most common protein in blood and plays a crucial role in drug absorption and transport. Predicting ALB binding can greatly impact drug discovery across various diseases.\n",
