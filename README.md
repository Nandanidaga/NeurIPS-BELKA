# ðŸ§¬ NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA

![BELKA Logo](images/belka_logo.png)

## Overview
In this competition, we'll develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific protein targets. This is a critical step in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry, paving the way for more accurate drug discovery. We'll help predict which drug-like small molecules (chemicals) will bind to three possible protein targets.
