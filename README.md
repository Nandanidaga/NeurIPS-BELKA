# 🧬 NeurIPS 2024 - Predict New Medicines with BELKA

![BELKA Logo](images/belka_logo.png)

## Overview
In this competition, you'll develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific protein targets. This is a critical step in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry, paving the way for more accurate drug discovery. You'll help predict which drug-like small molecules (chemicals) will bind to three possible protein targets.

### Important Dates
- **Start Date:** April 4, 2024
- **Entry Deadline:** July 1, 2024
- **Team Merger Deadline:** July 1, 2024
- **Final Submission Deadline:** July 8, 2024

## Prizes
🏆 **First Prize:** $12,000  
🥈 **Second Prize:** $10,000  
🥉 **Third Prize:** $10,000  
🏅 **Fourth Prize:** $8,000  
🎖️ **Fifth Prize:** $5,000  
👨‍🎓 **Top Student Group:** $5,000  

## Data Description
The competition dataset contains binding information for small molecules to three protein targets using DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) technology. The dataset includes:

- **train.csv / train.parquet**: Training data
- **test.csv / test.parquet**: Test data
- **sample_submission.csv**: Sample submission file

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competition is the average precision calculated for each (protein, split group) and then averaged for the final score. Please refer to the [official forum post](https://kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA/discussion) for more details.

### Code Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets.
- `images/`: Images and visuals for README and documentation.
